Adapting to Reality

Web design & development is hard

In the beginning... 640 x 480
Ok, we can go a little larger... 800x600
Ok, a bit larger, but that's it... 1024 x 768

We were ignoring mobile... 240 x 240 en 640 x 200
Until this happened... 320 x 480 en 3840 x 2160

Don't even get me started on tablets

Desktop today... 1920 x 1080 en 7680 x 4320

Chasing screen sizes is clearly a fool's errand

2008 - 71 screen resolutions
2014 - 1062 screen resolutions

2008 - 27 screens with 10 views
2014 - 200 screens with 10 views

You content can and will go anywhere that's connected
- wearables
- smart tvs
- IoT
- assistants

Meaning users will need to interact in different ways
- eye tracking
- t9
- touch
- mouse
- remote
- pen
- braille
- print
- keyboard
- audio
- gamepad

Over varied networks and in changing conditions
- wifi
- hardline
- mobile
- homes
- buildings
- cars
- buses
- trains
- airplanes

And, ultimately, our users all have different needs too

Anyone notice I haven't even mentioned browsers?

So...?!

Reality check, nothing about our users' experiences of (?)

Treat your ideal scenario as an edge user

Step by step
1. Focus on what matters
2. Write it out, then read it back
3. Look for semantics that support 1 & 2
4. Think about how design can improve comprehension
5. Consider how your design choices impact the reading experience
6. Think about the many different ways folks might interact
7. Map the potential experiences
8. Iterate
